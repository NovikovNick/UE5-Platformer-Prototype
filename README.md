### UE5-Platformer-Prototype

The prototype is creating as a presentable demonstration of the [platformer library](https://github.com/NovikovNick/platformer-prototype) functionality. The library itself is built as a separate .dll and connected to UE5 as a plugin. Some of the animations were created using the engine, some were downloaded from mixamo.
